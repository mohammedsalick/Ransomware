# **ThreatSafe: Ransomware Detection System**

**ThreatSafe** is a sophisticated ransomware detection and prevention system designed to protect your files and folders from malicious threats. It offers continuous monitoring of specified directories, identifies potential ransomware activity, and isolates harmful files to prevent system damage.

## **Key Features**

- **Folder Monitoring**: Allows users to select specific folders for monitoring suspicious activities and potential ransomware threats.

- **Real-Time Scan Results**: Provides immediate feedback on the status of files in monitored folders, flagging any suspicious files.

- **AI-Powered File Analysis**: Suspicious files are analyzed using advanced AI (Gemini AI) to assess threat levels and provide recommended actions.

- **Test Suite**: Includes five built-in tests to simulate ransomware behaviors, such as:
  - Rapid file creation
  - Detection of suspicious file extensions (e.g., `.encrypted`, `.wannacry`)
  - High-entropy file analysis
  - Rapid file modifications
  - Frequent file moves or renames

- **Quarantine System**: Automatically isolates suspicious files in a separate quarantine directory, preventing them from spreading or causing damage.

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides continuous folder surveillance with instant alerts for suspicious activities and automatic threat detection.

## **How It Works**

1. **Monitor Folders**: Enter the path of the folder you want to monitor, then click **"Scan Folder"** to begin monitoring.

2. **Scan and Analyze**: View scan results in real-time. For flagged files, you can:
   - **Analyze**: Use AI to assess the threat level and receive recommendations.
   - **Quarantine**: Move suspicious files to quarantine for isolation.

3. **Run Ransomware Simulations**: Test ThreatSafeâ€™s detection and response capabilities by running built-in ransomware behavior simulations.

**ThreatSafe** provides proactive ransomware defense with real-time monitoring and reactive measures by isolating and analyzing suspicious files. It helps ensure your system stays protected against evolving threats.
